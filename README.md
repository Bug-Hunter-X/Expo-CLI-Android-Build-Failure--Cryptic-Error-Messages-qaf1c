# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Cryptic Error Messages

This repository demonstrates a common yet challenging bug encountered when building Android APKs using Expo CLI. The build process often fails with unhelpful error messages, making it difficult to identify the root cause.  This example focuses on issues related to image assets and dependency conflicts, although other factors might also contribute.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is the lack of specific and actionable error messages during the Android build process.  Errors like `Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'` provide little guidance on resolving the problem.  This makes debugging time-consuming and frustrating.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo prebuild` (only if necessary depending on the exact bug).
4. Run `expo build:android` to attempt an Android build. Observe the error messages.

## Potential Causes and Solutions

* **Image Asset Issues:** Ensure that all images in the `assets` folder are properly formatted (e.g., PNG, JPG) and adhere to Android's size and resolution guidelines.  Incorrectly formatted or oversized images are frequent culprits.  Check for unsupported file types.
* **Dependency Conflicts:** Carefully examine the project's `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) for conflicting dependencies. Resolve version mismatches or try updating packages individually to identify the problematic package.
* **Android Build Tools:** Ensure the Android build tools are up-to-date. This might involve updating the Android SDK, build tools, and Gradle plugins.  Sometimes an older version of the Android SDK Build Tools can lead to such errors.   Clean and rebuild the project after updating.
