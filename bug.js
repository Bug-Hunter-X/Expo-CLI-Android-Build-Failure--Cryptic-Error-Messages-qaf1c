This bug occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with a cryptic error message, such as `Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'.`  The error log often doesn't pinpoint the exact cause, leading to significant debugging time.  This frequently happens when there are issues with image assets, particularly if they are improperly formatted or have unsupported file types within the project's `assets` folder.  Another less common cause is a mismatch or conflict within the project's dependencies, where versions clash or a package has unresolved issues.  Sometimes, it's due to a problem with the Android build tools themselves or their configuration within the Expo project.
